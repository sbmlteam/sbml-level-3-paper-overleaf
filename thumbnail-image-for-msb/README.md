Thumbnail image
===============

The MSB editors requested _"a 'thumbnail image' (115px width and 70px height, jpeg format) that can be used in the electronic table of content of the journal"_ to accompany the paper publication.  This directory contains the image we created and submitted to MSB in response to the request.

This image was created by Michael Hucka in April, 2020, from the original artwork for the ["SBML supported" logo](https://github.com/sbmlteam/logos-and-promos). The process consisted of using Adobe Illustrator CS6 to export the original artwork to JPEG format, then mildly edited in Adobe PhotoShop CS5 to produce the final image found here.  (Explanation for future reference: the export from Illustrator at 115 pixels produced a logo with a cut-off right edge but an extra 1&nbsp;pixel white strip along the left edge.  In Adobe PhotoShop CS5, I removed the left 1&nbsp;pixel vertical strip, then copied the left edge of the logo itself to the right of the image, thus repairing the logo and still producing a 115px image.  I then padded the logo vertically to produce a height of 70px.)
