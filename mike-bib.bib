As reconstructed networks leverage genomic data for insight and phenotype prediction, the development of COBRA methods has accelerated following the advent of whole-genome sequencing. Here, we describe a phylogeny of COBRA methods that has rapidly evolved from the few early methods, such as flux balance analysis and elementary flux mode analysis, into a repertoire of more than 100 methods. These methods have enabled genome-scale analysis of microbial metabolism for numerous basic and applied uses, including antibiotic discovery, metabolic engineering and modelling of microbial community behaviour.},
