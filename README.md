=================================

This repository contains source files for a manuscript on SBML Level&nbsp;3 submitted to _Molecular Systems Biology_ in 2020.  The paper was developed by the authors on Overleaf, and once submitted, a copy of the git repository from Overleaf was put on GitHub in this repository.  The response to the reviewer comments was made a separate document in [sbml-level-3-paper-response-letter](https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-level-3-paper-response-letter) and our response to reviewers included `latexdiff` output comparing the version that reviewers saw and the revised version, in [sbml-level-3-paper-diff](https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-level-3-paper-diff).  All 3 subrepositories are gathered together in [sbml-level-3-paper](https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-level-3-paper), a top-level umbrella repository.
