Sustainability means that the software used today will be available - and continue to be improved and supported - in the future. We report here an initial set of metrics that measure good practices in software development. This initiative differs from previously developed efforts in being a community-driven grassroots approach where experts from different organisations propose good software practices that have reasonable potential to be adopted by the communities they represent. We not only focus our efforts on understanding and prioritising good practices, we assess their feasibility for implementation and publish them here.},

Two aspects of such a visual diagram can be distinguished: the layout (i.e.: the positioning and connections) of the elements in the diagram, and the graphical form of the elements (for example, the glyphs used for symbols, the properties of the lines connecting them, and so on). This document describes the SBML Level~3 Render package that complements the SBML Level~3 Layout package and provides a means of capturing the precise rendering of the elements in a diagram. The SBML Level~3 Render package provides a flexible approach to rendering that is independent of both the underlying SBML model and the Layout information. There can be one block of render information that applies to all layouts or an additional block for each layout. Many of the elements used in the current render specification are based on corresponding elements from the SVG specification. This allows us to easily convert a combination of layout information and render information into a SVG drawing.},

For metabolism, constraint-based modelling methods systematize biochemical, genetic and genomic knowledge into a mathematical framework that enables a mechanistic description of metabolic physiology.

These studies have led to validation of increasingly important and relevant biological predictions. As reviewed here, these recent successes have tangible implications in the fields of microbial evolution, interaction networks, genetic engineering and drug discovery.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY: The XML-based Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) has
	emerged as a standard for storage, communication and interchange
	of models in systems biology. As a machine-readable format XML is
	difficult for humans to read and understand. Many tools are available
	that visualize the reaction pathways stored in SBML files, but many
	components, e.g., unit declarations, complex kinetic equations or
	links to MIRIAM resources, are often not made visible in these diagrams.
	For a broader understanding of the models, support in scientific
	writing and error detection, a human-readable report of the complete
	model is needed. We present SBML2\LaTeX, a Java-based stand-alone
	program to fill this gap. A convenient web service allows users to
	directly convert SBML to various formats, including DVI, \LaTeX{}
	and PDF, and provides many settings for customization. AVAILABILITY:
	Source code, documentation and a web service are freely available
	at \url{http://www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/SBML2LaTeX}.},

  abstract = {Collaborative genome-scale reconstruction endeavors of metabolic networks
	would not be possible without a common, standardized formal representation
	of these systems. The ability to precisely define biological building
	blocks together with their dynamic behavior has even been considered
	a prerequisite for upcoming synthetic biology approaches.
	
	Driven by the requirements of such ambitious research goals, standardization
	itself has become an active field of research on nearly all levels
	of granularity in biology. In addition to the originally envisaged
	exchange of computational models and tool interoperability, new standards
	have been suggested for an unambiguous graphical display of biological
	phenomena, to annotate, archive, as well as to rank models, and to
	describe execution and the outcomes of simulation experiments. The
	spectrum now even covers the interaction of entire neurons in the
	brain, three-dimensional motions, and the description of pharmacometric
	studies.
	
	Thereby, the mathematical description of systems and approaches for
	their (repeated) simulation are clearly separated from each other
	and also from their graphical representation. Minimum information
	definitions constitute guidelines and common operation protocols
	in order to ensure reproducibility of findings and a unified knowledge
	representation. Central database infrastructures have been established
	that provide the scientific community with persistent links from
	model annotations to on-line resources. A rich variety of open-source
	software tools thrives for all data formats, often supporting a multitude
	of programming languages. Regular meetings and workshops of developers
	and users lead to continuous improvement and ongoing development
	of these standardization efforts.
	
	This article gives a brief overview about the current state of the
	growing number of operation protocols, markup languages, graphical
	descriptions, and fundamental software support with relevance to
	systems biology.},

    diagrams in a visual form. Two aspects of such a visual diagram can be distinguished:
    the layout (i.e.: the positioning and connections) of the elements in the diagram, and
    the graphical form of the elements (for example, the glyphs used for symbols, the
    properties of the lines connecting them, and so on). For software tools that also read
    and write models in SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language) format, a common need is to
    store the network diagram together with the SBML representation of the model. This in
    turn raises the question of how to encode the layout and the rendering of these diagrams.
    The SBML Level~3 Version~1 Core specification does not provide a mechanism for explicitly
    encoding diagrams, but it does provide a mechanism for SBML packages to extend the Core
    specification and add additional syntactical constructs. The Layout package for SBML
    Level~3 adds the necessary features to SBML so that diagram layouts can be encoded in
    SBML files, and a companion package called SBML Rendering specifies how the graphical
    rendering of elements can be encoded. The SBML Layout package is based on the principle
    that reaction network diagrams should be described as representations of entities such
    as species and reactions (with direct links to the underlying SBML elements), and not as
    arbitrary drawings or graphs; for this reason, existing languages for the description of
    vector drawings (such as SVG) or general graphs (such as GraphML) cannot be used.},

Software applications have been developed which make it easier to create models of neural networks as well as detailed models which replicate the electrical activity of individual neurons. The code formats used by each of these applications are generally incompatible however, making it difficult to exchange models and ideas between researchers. Here we present the structure of a neuronal model description language, NeuroML. This provides a way to express these complex models in a common format based on the underlying physiology, allowing them to be mapped to multiple applications. We have tested this language by converting published neuronal models to NeuroML format and comparing their behavior on a number of commonly used simulators. Creating a common, accessible model description format will expose more of the model details to the wider neuroscience community, thus increasing their quality and reliability, as for other Open Source software. NeuroML will also allow a greater “ecosystem” of tools to be developed for building, simulating and analyzing these complex neuronal systems.},

Resource allocation was initially investigated in higher organisms by using empirical mathematical models based on mass distribution. A challenge is now to go a step further by reconciling the cellular scale to the individual scale. In the present paper, we review the foundations of modelling of resource allocation, particularly at the cellular scale: from small macro-molecular models to genome-scale cellular models. We enlighten how the combination of omic measurements and computational advances together with systems biology has contributed to dramatic progresses in the current understanding and prediction of cellular resource allocation. Accurate genome-wide predictive methods of resource allocation based on the resource balance analysis (RBA) framework have been developed and ensure a good trade-off between the complexity/tractability and the prediction capability of the model. The RBA framework shows promise for a wide range of applications in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology, and for pursuing investigations of the design principles of cellular and multi-cellular organisms.FBA, flux balance analysis; RBA, resource balance analysis},

Over the last four years, our team has been developing the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) in collaboration with an international community of modellers and software developers. SBML has become a de facto standard format for representing formal, quantitative and qualitative models at the level of biochemical reactions and regulatory networks.

SBML is oriented towards describing biological processes of the sort common in research on a number of topics, including metabolic pathways, cell signaling pathways, and many others. SBML is defined neutrally with respect to programming languages and software encoding; however, it is oriented primarily towards allowing models to be encoded using XML. This document contains many examples of SBML models written in XML.

The SBML Level~3 Version~1 Core specification does not provide a n explicit mechanism for expressing such relationships, but it does provide a mechanism for SBML packages to extend the Core specification and add additional syntactical constructs. The SBML Groups package for SBML Level~3 adds the necessary features to SBML to allow grouping of model components to be expressed. Such groups do not affect the mathematical interpretation of a model, but they do provide a way to add information that can be useful for modelers and software tools. The SBML Groups package enables a modeler to include definitions of groups and nested groups, each of which may be annotated to convey why that group was created, and what it represents.}

Studying these phenomena to develop noninvasive diagnostic tools and selective treatments is a promising avenue. Metabolic modeling has recently emerged as a new way to study human metabolism in a systematic, genome-scale manner by using pertinent high-throughput omics data. This method has been shown in various studies to provide fairly accurate estimates of the metabolic phenotype and its modifications following genetic and environmental perturbations. Here, we provide an overview of genome-scale metabolic modeling and its current use to model human metabolism in health and disease. We then describe the initial steps made using it to study cancer metabolism and how it may be harnessed to enhance ongoing experimental efforts to identify drug targets and biomarkers for cancer in a rationale-based manner.},

We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

We present AGORA (assembly of gut organisms through reconstruction and analysis), a resource of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions semi-automatically generated for 773 human gut bacteria. Using this resource, we identified a defined growth medium for Bacteroides caccae ATCC 34185. We also showed that interactions among modeled species depend on both the metabolic potential of each species and the nutrients available. AGORA reconstructions can integrate either metagenomic or 16S rRNA sequencing data sets to infer the metabolic diversity of microbial communities. AGORA reconstructions could provide a starting point for the generation of high-quality, manually curated metabolic reconstructions. AGORA is fully compatible with Recon 2, a comprehensive metabolic reconstruction of human metabolism, which will facilitate studies of host-microbiome interactions.},

  abstract = {Growth is a fundamental process of life. Growth requirements are well-characterized experimentally for many microbes; however, we lack a unified model for cellular growth. Such a model must be predictive of events at the molecular scale and capable of explaining the high-level behavior of the cell as a whole. Here, we construct an ME-Model for Escherichia coli—a genome-scale model that seamlessly integrates metabolic and gene product expression pathways. The model computes {\~{}}80{\%} of the functional proteome (by mass), which is used by the cell to support growth under a given condition. Metabolism and gene expression are interdependent processes that affect and constrain each other. We formalize these constraints and apply the principle of growth optimization to enable the accurate prediction of multi-scale phenotypes, ranging from coarse-grained (growth rate, nutrient uptake, by-product secretion) to fine-grained (metabolic fluxes, gene expression levels). Our results unify many existing principles developed to describe bacterial growth.},

    (FBC) Package extends SBML Level~3 and provides a standardized format for the

The project has developed a modular simulation engine to create computational models of the worm. The modularity of the engine makes it possible to easily modify the model, incorporate new experimental data and test hypotheses. The modeling framework incorporates both biophysical neuronal simulations and a novel fluid-dynamics-based soft-tissue simulation for physical environment-body interactions. The project's open-science approach is aimed at overcoming the difficulties of integrative modeling within a traditional academic environment. In this article the rationale is presented for creating the OpenWorm collaboration, the tools and resources developed thus far are outlined and the unique challenges associated with the project are discussed.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: LibSBGN is a software library for reading, writing and manipulating Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) maps stored using the recently developed SBGN-ML file format. The library (available in C++ and Java) makes it easy for developers to add SBGN support to their tools, whereas the file format facilitates the exchange of maps between compatible software applications. The library also supports validation of maps, which simplifies the task of ensuring compliance with the detailed SBGN specifications. With this effort we hope to increase the adoption of SBGN in bioinformatics tools, ultimately enabling more researchers to visualize biological knowledge in a precise and unambiguous manner.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Milestone 2 was released in December 2011.

  abstract = {As microbes face changing environments, they dynamically allocate macromolecular resources to produce a particular phenotypic state. Broad ‘omics' data sets have revealed several interesting phenomena regarding how the proteome is allocated under differing conditions, but the functional consequences of these states and how they are achieved remain open questions. Various types of multi-scale mathematical models have been used to elucidate the genetic basis for systems-level adaptations. In this review, we outline several different strategies by which microbes accomplish resource allocation and detail how mathematical models have aided in our understanding of these processes. Ultimately, such modeling efforts have helped elucidate the principles of proteome allocation and hold promise for further discovery.},

	abstract = {This paper was refereed by the Journal of Electronic Publishing’s peer reviewers., Standardization is a poorly understood discipline in practice. While there are excellent studies of standardization as an economic phenomenon, or as technical a phenomenon, or as a policy initiative, most of these are ex post facto and written from a dispassionate academic view. They are of little help to practitioners who actually are using and creating standards. The person actually creating the standards is working in an area of imperfect knowledge, high economic incentives, changing relationships, and often, short-range planning. The ostensible failure of a standard has to be examined not so much from the focus of whether the standard or specification was written or even implemented (the usual metric), but rather from the viewpoint of whether the participants achieved their goals from their participation in the standardization process. To achieve this, various examples are used to illustrate how expectations from a standardization process may vary, so that what is perceived as a market failure may very well be a signal success for some of the participants. The paper is experientially, not empirically based, and relies on my observations as an empowered, embedded, and occasionally neutral observer in the Information Technology standardization arena. Because of my background, the paper does have a focus on computing standards, rather than publishing standards. However, from what I have observed, the lessons learned apply equally to all standardization activities, from heavy machinery to quality to publishing. Standards names may vary; human nature doesn’t.},

	abstract = {The Virtual Cell (VCell; http://vcell.org/) is a problem solving environment, built on a central database, for analysis, modelling and simulation of cell biological processes. VCell integrates a growing range of molecular mechanisms, including reaction kinetics, diffusion, ﬂow, membrane transport, lateral membrane diffusion and electrophysiology, and can associate these with geometries derived from experimental microscope images. It has been developed and deployed as a web-based, distributed, client– server system, with more than a thousand world-wide users. VCell provides a separation of layers (core technologies and abstractions) representing biological models, physical mechanisms, geometry, mathematical models and numerical methods. This separation clariﬁes the impact of modelling decisions, assumptions and approximations. The result is a physically consistent, mathematically rigorous, spatial modelling and simulation framework. Users create biological models and VCell will automatically (i) generate the appropriate mathematical encoding for running a simulation and (ii) generate and compile the appropriate computer code. Both deterministic and stochastic algorithms are supported for describing and running non-spatial simulations; a full partial differential equation solver using the ﬁnite volume numerical algorithm is available for reaction–diffusion–advection simulations in complex cell geometries including 3D geometries derived from microscope images. Using the VCell database, models and model components can be reused and updated, as well as privately shared among collaborating groups, or published. Exchange of models with other tools is possible via import/export of SBML, CellML and MatLab formats. Furthermore, curation of models is facilitated by external database binding mechanisms for unique identiﬁcation of components and by standardised annotations compliant with the MIRIAM standard. VCell is now open source, with its native model encoding language (VCML) being a public speciﬁcation, which stands as the basis for a new generation of more customised, experiment-centric modelling tools using a new plug-in based platform.},

During simulations, rules operate directly on molecular objects to produce exact stochastic results with performance that scales independently of the reaction network size. Reaction rates can be defined as arbitrary functions of molecular states to provide powerful coarse-graining capabilities, for example to merge Boolean and kinetic representations of biological networks. NFsim enables researchers to simulate many biological systems that were previously inaccessible to general-purpose software, as we illustrate with models of immune system signaling, microbial signaling, cytoskeletal assembly and oscillating gene expression.},

	abstract = {Multi-state modeling of biomolecules refers to a series of techniques used to represent and compute the behavior of biological molecules or complexes that can adopt a large number of possible functional states. Biological signaling systems often rely on complexes of biological macromolecules that can undergo several functionally significant modifications that are mutually compatible. Thus, they can exist in a very large number of functionally different states. Modeling such multi-state systems poses two problems: the problem of how to describe and specify a multi-state system (the {\textquotedblleft}specification problem{\textquotedblright}) and the problem of how to use a computer to simulate the progress of the system over time (the {\textquotedblleft}computation problem{\textquotedblright}). To address the specification problem, modelers have in recent years moved away from explicit specification of all possible states and towards rule-based formalisms that allow for implicit model specification, including the $\kappa$-calculus [1], BioNetGen [2]{\textendash}[5], the Allosteric Network Compiler [6], and others [7], [8]. To tackle the computation problem, they have turned to particle-based methods that have in many cases proved more computationally efficient than population-based methods based on ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, or the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm [9], [10]. Given current computing technology, particle-based methods are sometimes the only possible option. Particle-based simulators fall into two further categories: nonspatial simulators, such as StochSim [11], DYNSTOC [12], RuleMonkey [9], [13], and the Network-Free Stochastic Simulator (NFSim) [14], and spatial simulators, including Meredys [15], SRSim [16], [17], and MCell [18]{\textendash}[20]. Modelers can thus choose from a variety of tools, the best choice depending on the particular problem. Development of faster and more powerful methods is ongoing, promising the ability to simulate ever more complex signaling processes in the future.},

	doi = {10.1002/wsbm.1245},
	abstract = {Rule-based modeling was developed to address the limitations of traditional approaches for modeling chemical kinetics in cell signaling systems. These systems consist of multiple interacting biomolecules (e.g., proteins), which themselves consist of multiple parts (e.g., domains, linear motifs, and sites of phosphorylation). Consequently, biomolecules that mediate information processing generally have the potential to interact in multiple ways, with the number of possible complexes and posttranslational modification states tending to grow exponentially with the number of binary interactions considered. As a result, only large reaction networks capture all possible consequences of the molecular interactions that occur in a cell signaling system, which is problematic because traditional modeling approaches for chemical kinetics (e.g., ordinary differential equations) require explicit network specification. This problem is circumvented through representation of interactions in terms of local rules. With this approach, network specification is implicit and model specification is concise. Concise representation results in a coarse graining of chemical kinetics, which is introduced because all reactions implied by a rule inherit the rate law associated with that rule. Coarse graining can be appropriate if interactions are modular, and the coarseness of a model can be adjusted as needed. Rules can be specified using specialized model-specification languages, and recently developed tools designed for specification of rule-based models allow one to leverage powerful software engineering capabilities. A rule-based model comprises a set of rules, which can be processed by general-purpose simulation and analysis tools to achieve different objectives (e.g., to perform either a deterministic or stochastic simulation).

Analysis of the atomized reactions reveals simplifying assumptions made in the construction of a model that limit the combinatorial complexity. These benefits are elucidated through a case study.

	abstract = {Many activities of cells are controlled by cell-surface receptors, which in response to ligands, trigger intracellular signaling reactions that elicit cellular responses. A hallmark of these signaling reactions is the reversible nucleation of multicomponent complexes, which typically begin to assemble when ligand-receptor binding allows an enzyme, often a kinase, to create docking sites for signaling molecules through chemical modifications, such as tyrosine phosphorylation. One function of such docking sites is the co-localization of enzymes with their substrates, which can enhance both enzyme activity and specificity. The directed assembly of complexes can also influence the sensitivity of cellular responses to ligand-receptor binding kinetics and determine whether a cellular response is up- or downregulated in response to a ligand stimulus. The full functional implications of ligand-stimulated complex formation are difficult to discern intuitively. Complex formation is governed by conditional interactions among multivalent signaling molecules and influenced by quantitative properties of both the components in a system and the system itself. Even a simple list of the complexes that can potentially form in response to a ligand stimulus is problematic because of the number of ways signaling molecules can be modified and combined. Here, we review the role of multicomponent complexes in signal transduction and advocate the use of mathematical models that incorporate detail at the level of molecular domains to study this important aspect of cellular signaling. {\textcopyright} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The field requires novel approaches for abstraction, for modeling bioprocesses that follow different biochemical and biophysical rules, and for combining different modules into larger models that still allow realistic simulation with the computational power available today. We have identified and discussed currently most prominent problems in systems biology: (1) how to bridge different scales of modeling abstraction, (2) how to bridge the gap between topological and mechanistic modeling, and (3) how to bridge the wet and dry laboratory gap.

	abstract = {System Biology encompasses the knowledge from diverse fields such as Molecular Biology, Immunology, Genetics, Computational Biology, Mathematical Biology, etc. not only to address key questions that are not answerable by individual fields alone, but also to help in our understanding of the complexities of biological systems. Whole genome expression studies have provided us the means of studying the expression of thousands of genes under a particular condition and this technique had been widely used to find out the role of key macromolecules that are involved in biological signaling pathways. However, making sense of the underlying complexity is only possible if we interconnect various signaling pathways into human and computer readable network maps. These maps can then be used to classify and study individual components involved in a particular phenomenon. Apart from transcriptomics, several individual gene studies have resulted in adding to our knowledge of key components that are involved in a signaling pathway. It therefore becomes imperative to take into account of these studies also, while constructing our network maps to highlight the interconnectedness of the entire signaling pathways and the role of that particular individual protein in the pathway. This collection of articles will contain a collection of pioneering work done by scientists working in regulatory signaling networks and the use of large scale gene expression and omics data. The distinctive features of this book would be: Act a single source of information to understand the various components of different signaling network (roadmap of biochemical pathways, the nature of a molecule of interest in a particular pathway, etc.), Serve as a platform to highlight the key findings in this highly volatile and evolving field, and Provide answers to various techniques both related to microarray and cell signaling to the readers.},

In this volume - using mathematical modeling - processes are described from the biophysics of the interaction of light with pigment systems to the mutual interaction of individual plants and other organisms in canopies and large ecosystems, up to the global ecosystem issues. Chapters are written by 44 international authorities from 15 countries. Mathematics is a powerful tool for quantitative analysis. Properly programmed, contemporary computers are able to mimic complicated processes in living cells, leaves, canopies and ecosystems. These simulations - mathematical models - help us predict the photosynthetic responses of modeled systems under various combinations of environmental conditions, potentially occurring in nature, e.g., the responses of plant canopies to globally increasing temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration. Tremendous analytical power is needed to understand nature's infinite complexity at every level.},

Many tools have been developed to convert computational models from one format to another. However, they have been developed independently, resulting in redundancy of efforts and lack of synergy.
Results: Here we present the System Biology Format Converter (SBFC), which provide a generic framework to potentially convert any format into another. The framework currently includes several converters translating between the following formats: SBML, BioPAX, SBGN-ML, Matlab, Octave, XPP, GPML, Dot, MDL and APM. This software is written in Java and can be used as a standalone executable or web service.
Conclusions: The SBFC framework is an evolving software project. Existing converters can be used and improved, and new converters can be easily added, making SBFC useful to both modellers and developers. The source code and documentation of the framework are freely available from the project web site.},

	abstract = {Modelling is becoming a necessity in studying biological signalling pathways, because the combinatorial complexity of such systems rapidly overwhelms intuitive and qualitative forms of reasoning. Yet, this same combinatorial explosion makes the traditional modelling paradigm based on systems of differential equations impractical. In contrast, agentbased or concurrent languages, such as ? [1,2,3] or the closely related BioNetGen language [4,5,6,7,8,9,10], describe biological interactions in terms of rules, thereby avoiding the combinatorial explosion besetting differential equations. Rules are expressed in an intuitive graphical form that transparently represents biological knowledge. In this way, rules become a natural unit of model building, modification, and discussion. We illustrate this with a sizeable example obtained from refactoring two models of EGF receptor signalling that are based on differential equations [11,12]. An exciting aspect of the agent-based approach is that it naturally lends itself to the identification and analysis of the causal structures that deeply shape the dynamical, and perhaps even evolutionary, characteristics of complex distributed biological systems. In particular, one can adapt the notions of causality and conflict, familiar from concurrency theory, to ?, our representation language of choice. Using the EGF receptor model as an example, we show how causality enables the formalization of the colloquial concept of pathway and, perhaps more surprisingly, how conflict can be used to dissect the signalling dynamics to obtain a qualitative handle on the range of system behaviours. By taming the combinatorial explosion, and exposing the causal structures and key kinetic junctures in a model, agent- and rule-based representations hold promise for making modelling more powerful, more perspicuous, and of appeal to a wider audience.},

Tellurium Notebook, a Python-based Jupyter-like environment, is designed to seamlessly inter-operate with these community standards by automating conversion between COMBINE standards formulations and corresponding in-line, human-readable representations. Thus, Tellurium brings to systems biology the strategy used by other literate notebook systems such as Mathematica. These capabilities allow users to edit every aspect of the standards-compliant models and simulations, run the simulations in-line, and re-export to standard formats. We provide several use cases illustrating the advantages of our approach and how it allows development and reuse of models without requiring technical knowledge of standards.

We review the benefits of reusable virtual experiments: in specifying, assaying, and comparing the behavioural repertoires of models; as prerequisites for reproducible research; to guide model reuse and composition; and for quality assurance in the translational application of models.

processes. Many of these models can be represented as biochemical reaction

share similar reactions and mechanisms. Typical goals of an investigation
thus include understanding of model parts, identification of reoccurring
patterns and recognition of biologically relevant motifs. The large number
and size of available models, however, require automated methods to
support researchers in achieving their goals. Specifically for the problem
of finding patterns in large networks only partial solutions exist. We
propose a workflow that identifies frequent structural patterns in
biochemical reaction networks encoded in the Systems Biology Markup
Language. The workflow utilizes a subgraph mining algorithm to detect the
network patterns. Once patterns are identified, the textual pattern
description can automatically be converted into a graphical
representation. Furthermore, information about the distribution of
patterns among a selected set of models can be retrieved. The workflow was
validated with 575 models from the curated branch of BioModels. In this
paper, we highlight interesting and frequent structural patterns.
Furthermore, we provide exemplary patterns that incorporate terms from the
Systems Biology Ontology. Our workflow can be applied to a custom set of
models or to models already existing in our graph database MaSyMoS. The
occurrences of frequent patterns may give insight into the encoding of
central biological processes, evaluate postulated biological motifs or
serve as a similarity measure for models that share common

Creating reusable models is worthwhile, but it requires some efforts when a model is developed, implemented, documented, and published. Minimum requirements for published systems biology models have been formulated by the MIRIAM initiative. Main criteria are completeness of information and documentation, availability of machine-readable models in standard formats, and semantic annotations connecting the model elements with entries in biological Web resources. In this chapter, we discuss the assumptions behind bottom-up modeling; present important standards like MIRIAM, the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), and the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN); and describe software tools and services for handling semantic annotations.

A major challenge of systems biology is to describe biological systems as a computational model, which can be used to derive novel hypothesis and drive experiments leading to new knowledge. The constraint-based reconstruction and analysis approach has been successfully applied to metabolism and to the macromolecular synthesis machinery assembly. Here, we present the first integrated stoichiometric multiscale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis for Escherichia coli K12 MG1655, which describes the sequence-specific synthesis and function of almost 2000 gene products at molecular detail. We added linear constraints, which couple enzyme synthesis and catalysis reactions. Comparison with experimental data showed improvement of growth phenotype prediction with the multiscale model over E. coli{\textquoteright}s metabolic model alone. Many of the genes covered by this integrated model are well conserved across enterobacters and other, less related bacteria. We addressed the question of whether the bias in synonymous codon usage could affect the growth phenotype and environmental niches that an organism can occupy. We created two classes of in silico strains, one with more biased codon usage and one with more equilibrated codon usage than the wildtype. The reduced growth phenotype in biased strains was caused by tRNA supply shortage, indicating that expansion of tRNA gene content or tRNA codon recognition allow E. coli to respond to changes in codon usage bias. Our analysis suggests that in order to maximize growth and to adapt to new environmental niches, codon usage and tRNA content must co-evolve. These results provide further evidence for the mutation-selection-drift balance theory of codon usage bias. This integrated multiscale reconstruction successfully demonstrates that the constraint-based modeling approach is well suited to whole-cell modeling endeavors.},

	abstract = {Genome-scale models of metabolism and macromolecular expression (ME-models) explicitly compute the optimal proteome composition of a growing cell. ME-models expand upon the well-established genome-scale models of metabolism (M-models), and they enable a new fundamental understanding of cellular growth. ME-models have increased predictive capabilities and accuracy due to their inclusion of the biosynthetic costs for the machinery of life, but they come with a significant increase in model size and complexity. This challenge results in models which are both difficult to compute and challenging to understand conceptually. As a result, ME-models exist for only two organisms (Escherichia coli and Thermotoga maritima) and are still used by relatively few researchers. To address these challenges, we have developed a new software framework called COBRAme for building and simulating ME-models. It is coded in Python and built on COBRApy, a popular platform for using M-models. COBRAme streamlines computation and analysis of ME-models. It provides tools to simplify constructing and editing ME-models to enable ME-model reconstructions for new organisms. We used COBRAme to reconstruct a condensed E. coli ME-model called iJL1678b-ME. This reformulated model gives functionally identical solutions to previous E. coli ME-models while using 1/6 the number of free variables and solving in less than 10 minutes, a marked improvement over the 6 hour solve time of previous ME-model formulations. Errors in previous ME-models were also corrected leading to 52 additional genes that must be expressed in iJL1678b-ME to grow aerobically in glucose minimal in silico media. This manuscript outlines the architecture of COBRAme and demonstrates how ME-models can be created, modified, and shared most efficiently using the new software framework.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Model repositories such as BioModels Database provide
computational models of biological systems for the scientific community.
These models contain rich semantic annotations that link model entities to
concepts in well-established bio-ontologies such as Gene Ontology.
Consequently, thematically similar models are likely to share similar
annotations. Based on this assumption, we argue that semantic annotations
are a suitable tool to characterize sets of models. These characteristics
improve model classification, allow to identify additional features for
model retrieval tasks, and enable the comparison of sets of models.
RESULTS: In this paper we discuss four methods for annotation-based
feature extraction from model sets. We tested all methods on sets of
models in SBML format which were composed from BioModels Database. To
characterize each of these sets, we analyzed and extracted concepts from
three frequently used ontologies, namely Gene Ontology, ChEBI and SBO. We
find that three out of the methods are suitable to determine
characteristic features for arbitrary sets of models: The selected
features vary depending on the underlying model set, and they are also
specific to the chosen model set. We show that the identified features map
on concepts that are higher up in the hierarchy of the ontologies than the
concepts used for model annotations. Our analysis also reveals that the
information content of concepts in ontologies and their usage for model
annotation do not correlate. CONCLUSIONS: Annotation-based feature
extraction enables the comparison of model sets, as opposed to existing
methods for model-to-keyword comparison, or model-to-model comparison.},

Ideally, the retrieval and integration of biological knowledge for model annotation should be performed quickly, precisely, and with a minimum of manual effort.
Results: Here we present rule-based mediation, a method of semantic data integration applied to systems biology model annotation. The heterogeneous data sources are first syntactically converted into ontologies, which are then aligned to a small domain ontology by applying a rule base. We demonstrate proof-of-principle of this application of rule-based mediation using off-the-shelf semantic web technology through two use cases for SBML model annotation. Existing tools and technology provide a framework around which the system is built, reducing development time and increasing usability.
Conclusions: Integrating resources in this way accommodates multiple formats with different semantics, and provides richly-modelled biological knowledge suitable for annotation of SBML models. This initial work establishes the feasibility of rule-based mediation as part of an automated SBML model annotation system.

	abstract = {Background: To enable automatic searches, alignments, and model combination, the elements of systems biology models need to be compared and matched across models. Elements can be identified by machine-readable biological annotations, but assigning such annotations and matching non-annotated elements is tedious work and calls for automation.
Results: A new method called {\textquotedblleft}semantic propagation{\textquotedblright} allows the comparison of model elements based not only on their own annotations, but also on annotations of surrounding elements in the network. One may either propagate feature vectors, describing the annotations of individual elements, or quantitative similarities between elements from different models. Based on semantic propagation, we align partially annotated models and find annotations for non-annotated model elements.
Conclusions: Semantic propagation and model alignment are included in the open-source library semanticSBML, available on sourceforge. Online services for model alignment and for annotation prediction can be used at http:// www.semanticsbml.org.},

This article extends the literature by studying journal data sharing policies by year (for both 2011 and 2012) for a referent set of 170 journals. We make a further contribution by evaluating code sharing policies, supplemental materials policies, and open access status for these 170 journals for each of 2011 and 2012. We build a predictive model of open data and code policy adoption as a function of impact factor and publisher and find higher impact journals more likely to have open data and code policies and scientific societies more likely to have open data and code policies than commercial publishers. We also find open data policies tend to lead open code policies, and we find no relationship between open data and code policies and either supplemental material policies or open access journal status. Of the journals in this study, 38\% had a data policy, 22\% had a code policy, and 66\% had a supplemental materials policy as of June 2012. This reflects a striking one year increase of 16\% in the number of data policies, a 30\% increase in code policies, and a 7\% increase in the number of supplemental materials policies. We introduce a new dataset to the community that categorizes data and code sharing, supplemental materials, and open access policies in 2011 and 2012 for these 170 journals.},

When those steps have been described in sufficient detail that others can retrace the steps and obtain similar results, the research is said to be reproducible. Computers play a vital role in many research disciplines and present both opportunities and challenges for reproducibility. Computers can be programmed to execute analysis tasks, and those programs can be repeated and shared with others. The deterministic nature of most computer programs means that the same analysis tasks, applied to the same data, will often produce the same outputs. However, in practice, computational findings often cannot be reproduced because of complexities in how software is packaged, installed, and executed{\textemdash}and because of limitations associated with how scientists document analysis steps. Many tools and techniques are available to help overcome these challenges; here we describe seven such strategies. With a broad scientific audience in mind, we describe the strengths and limitations of each approach, as well as the circumstances under which each might be applied. No single strategy is sufficient for every scenario; thus we emphasize that it is often useful to combine approaches.},

	abstract = {My perspective does not deal directly with photosynthesis research. However, the methods evolved have played an important role in several areas of biochemistry and biophysics including photosynthesis. Improvements of rapid reaction methods, based upon the pioneering studies of Hamilton Hartridge and F.J.W. Roughton, and Glenn Millikan, required a detailed study of the hydraulics of small-bore tubes and jet mixers, taking into account, that economy of reactants was demanded by the sparcity of enzyme preparations in the 1930s. This Personal perspective recites the steps taken to minimize the volumes expended in rapid flow studies, together with the improvements in electronic technology of rapid and sensitive spectrophotometry of labile intermediates in enzyme reactions. Of the methods studied, continuous, accelerated and stopped flow, the latter was designed for the highest fluid economy and subsequently proved to be of wide use for studying biochemical kinetics. Advances in fast spectrophotometry of dilute solutions led to great improvements in Millikan{\textquoteright}s dual-wavelength system, both in speed of recording and decreases of background noise level, largely due to electronic stabilization of light sources and sensitive amplifiers. The application of these technologies to studies of hemoglobin, myoglobin and heme enzymes was, more recently, followed by studies of suspensions of organelles, cells, and tissues not only in vivo but also at low temperatures with cryoprotectants, leading to the use of flash activation in carbon monoxide inhibited heme enzymes. Laser technology allowed photosynthetic systems to be studied at cryotemperatures, leading to the development of electron tunneling theories for biological reactions (not discussed in this paper). All in all, the many fundamental developments of electronics, optics and hydraulics indicate how technology can respond effectively to the needs of biology in general, and photobiology in particular.},

	abstract = {Background: Open model repositories provide ready-to-reuse computational models of biological systems. Models within those repositories evolve over time, leading to different model versions. Taken together, the underlying changes reflect a model{\textquoteright}s provenance and thus can give valuable insights into the studied biology. Currently, however, changes cannot be semantically interpreted. To improve this situation, we developed an ontology of terms describing changes in models. The ontology can be used by scientists and within software to characterise model updates at the level of single changes. When studying or reusing a model, these annotations help with determining the relevance of a change in a given context.
Methods: We manually studied changes in selected models from BioModels and the Physiome Model Repository. Using the BiVeS tool for difference detection, we then performed an automatic analysis of changes in all models published in these repositories. The resulting set of concepts led us to define candidate terms for the ontology. In a final step, we aggregated and classified these terms and built the first version of the ontology.
Results: We present COMODI, an ontology needed because COmputational MOdels DIffer. It empowers users and software to describe changes in a model on the semantic level. COMODI also enables software to implement user-specific filter options for the display of model changes. Finally, COMODI is a step towards predicting how a change in a model influences the simulation results.
Conclusion: COMODI, coupled with our algorithm for difference detection, ensures the transparency of a model{\textquoteright}s evolution, and it enhances the traceability of updates and error corrections. COMODI is encoded in OWL. It is openly available at http://comodi.sems.uni-rostock.de/.},

	abstract = {Reproducible experiments are the cornerstone of science: only observations that can be independently confirmed enter the body of scientific knowledge. Computational science should excel in reproducibility, as simulations on digital computers avoid many of the small variations that are beyond the control of the experimental biologist or physicist. However, in reality, computational science has its own challenges for reproducibility: many computational scientists find it difficult to reproduce results published in the literature, and many authors have met problems replicating even the figures in their own papers. We present a distinction between different levels of replicability and reproducibility of findings in computational neuroscience. We also demonstrate that simulations of neural models can be highly sensitive to numerical details, and conclude that often it is futile to expect exact replicability of simulation results across simulator software packages. Thus, the computational neuroscience community needs to discuss how to define successful reproduction of simulation studies. Any investigation of failures to reproduce published results will benefit significantly from the ability to track the provenance of the original results. We present tools and best practices developed over the past 2 decades that facilitate provenance tracking and model sharing.},

	abstract = {In Mathematical Biology, many dynamical models of biochemical reaction systems are presented with Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). Once kinetic parameter values are fixed, this simple mathematical formalism completely defines the dynamical behavior of a system of biochemical reactions and provides powerful tools for deterministic simulations, parameter sensitivity analysis, bifurcation analysis, etc. However, without requiring any information on the reaction kinetics and parameter values, various qualitative analyses can be performed using the structure of the reactions, provided the reactants, products and modifiers of each reaction are precisely defined. In order to apply these structural methods to parametric ODE models, we study a mathematical condition for expressing the consistency between the structure and the kinetics of a reaction, without restricting to Mass Action law kinetics. This condition, satisfied in particular by standard kinetic laws, entails a remarkable property of independence of the influence graph from the kinetics of the reactions. We derive from this study a heuristic algorithm which, given a system of ODEs as input, computes a system of reactions with the same ODE semantics, by inferring well-formed reactions whenever possible. We show how this strategy is capable of automatically curating the writing of ODE models in SBML, and present some statistics obtained on the model repository biomodels.net.},

These metabolic networks provide detailed information about the metabolism inside the cells, coupled with the genomic, proteomic and thermodynamic information. These networks are widely simulated using {\textquoteleft}constraint-based{\textquoteright} modelling techniques and find applications ranging from strain improvement for metabolic engineering to prediction of drug targets in pathogenic organisms. Components of these metabolic networks are represented in multiple file formats and also using different markup languages, with varying levels of annotations; this leads to inconsistencies and increases the complexities in comparing and analysing reconstructions on multiple platforms. In this work, we critically examine nearly 100 published genome-scale metabolic networks and their corresponding constraint-based models and discuss various issues with respect to model quality. One of the major concerns is the lack of annotations using standard identifiers that can uniquely describe several components such as metabolites, genes, proteins and reactions. We also find that many models do not have complete information regarding constraints on reactions fluxes and objective functions for carrying out simulations. Overall, our analysis highlights the need for a widely acceptable standard for representing constraint-based models. A rigorous standard can help in streamlining the process of reconstruction and improve the quality of reconstructed metabolic models.},

	abstract = {Motivation Systems biology models are typically simulated using a single formalism such as ordinary differential equations (ODE) or stochastic methods. However, more complex models require the coupling of multiple formalisms since different biological concepts are better described using different methods, e.g., stationary metabolism is often modeled using flux-balance analysis (FBA) whereas dynamic changes of model components are better described via ODEs. The coupling of FBA and ODE frameworks results in dynamic FBA models. A major challenge is how to describe such hybrid models coupling multiple frameworks in a standardized way, so that they can be exchanged between tools and simulated consistently and in a reproducible manner.Results This paper presents a scheme and implementation for encoding dynamic FBA models in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), thereby allowing to exchange multi-framework computational models between software tools. The paper shows the feasibility of the approach using various example models and demonstrates that different tools are able to simulate the hybrid models and agree on the results. As part of this work, two independent implementations of a multi-framework simulation method for dynamic FBA have been developed supporting such models: iBioSim and sbmlutils.Availability All materials and models are available from https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/dfba.

  abstract = {Abstract
            Computational modelling has become increasingly common in life science research. To provide a platform to support universal sharing, easy accessibility and model reproducibility, BioModels (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/), a repository for mathematical models, was established in 2005. The current BioModels platform allows submission of models encoded in diverse modelling formats, including SBML, CellML, PharmML, COMBINE archive, MATLAB, Mathematica, R, Python or C++. The models submitted to BioModels are curated to verify the computational representation of the biological process and the reproducibility of the simulation results in the reference publication. The curation also involves encoding models in standard formats and annotation with controlled vocabularies following MIRIAM (minimal information required in the annotation of biochemical models)~guidelines. BioModels now accepts large-scale submission of auto-generated computational models. With gradual growth in content over 15 years, BioModels currently hosts about 2000 models from the published literature. With about 800 curated models, BioModels has become the world's largest repository of curated models and emerged as the third most used data resource after PubMed and Google Scholar among the scientists who use modelling in their research. Thus, BioModels benefits modellers by providing access to reliable and semantically enriched curated models in standard formats that are easy to share, reproduce and reuse.},
